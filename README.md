# CourseraProjects
A R script and a code book for a course project, "Getting and Cleaning Data" on Coursera

The script runs from reading in the given input text files, to writing a final tidy data set into a text file, by following the following 5 steps in the project instruction:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Variable defintions and function of statements for each step are described as the comments in the R script.
